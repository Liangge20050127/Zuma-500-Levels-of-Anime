</P>

<P><A name="I/I"><B>Introduction</B></A></P>
<P>Can you discover the secrets of Anime? Their hidden portals in the world teem with traps and tricks! It will take a quick hand and a sharp eye to uncover Secrets of Anime...</P>
<P>Zuma - 500 Levels of Anime is an custom mod by Liangge within 500 Levels. If you are new to the mod, you should start with the Adventure mode, and move on to Gauntlet once you are experienced with the game.</P>
<P><A name="I/CP"><B>Create Your Profile</B></A></P>
<P>When you first launch the mod, you will be asked for your name. Your progress and high scores will be saved when you quit. If there are several people playing on one computer, you will want to create separate profiles for each. To do this, click on the link at the top of the screen that reads, "If this is not you, click here." A dialog will appear allowing you to select another identity, or create a new one.</P>
<P><A name="I/GS"><B>Game Selection</B></A></P>
<P>You can choose either Adventure or Gauntlet mode.</P>
<P>Adventure mode is best for new players. You will explore a series of portals in search of Anime with 500 levels. Each temple is divided into three stages and each stage has several levels. When a level is described with two numbers, such as Stage 2, that means it has 40 levels in this stage.</P>
<P>Gauntlet mode is better for experienced players. As you complete levels in Adventure mode, they are unlocked in the Gauntlet mode. You can then play an endless game on any of them, or on a random succession of levels, trying to earn higher ranks and the fabled Rainbow Gem.</P>
<P><A name="I/O"><B>Options</B></A></P>
<P>The Options are accessible from the first game selection screen, or by clicking the Menu button while playing the game. They include:
<UL>
	<LI><B>Music Volume and Sound Effects:</B> you can adjust these volume sliders separately to fit your preferences.</LI>
	<LI><B>Fullscreen:</B> If this is checked, Zuma will use your entire computer screen. If it is not checked, Zuma will be played in a window. It'll up to you to decide which you prefer.</LI>
	<LI><B>Custom Cursors:</B> If this box is checked, you will see special custom Zuma cursors in the game rather than Windows standard cursors. If you have a special theme installed that changes your Windows cursors, you may need to activate this option to see the cursor properly in the game.</LI>
	<LI class="accelerate"><B>3-D Hardware Acceleration:</B> This box can be checked to improve performance for computers with supported video cards.</LI>
	<LI><B>Help:</B> This will show you an instructions screen on how to play Zuma.</LI>
	<LI><B>Check for Updates:</B> This will check via the internet to see if there are any new versions of Zuma available for you to download. New versions may fix bugs or add new features.</LI>
</UL></P>

<P class=header>
<A name="HTP"><B>Tutorial - Basics</B> <A href="#top">[back to top]</A></A>
</P>

<P><A name="HTP/Controls"><B>Controls</B></A></P>
<P>The controls for Zuma are very simple,also in the mod:</P>
<P>Point your mouse cursor somewhere on the screen and left click, and the shooter will fire the crystal ball in its mouth towards the cursor. Right click your mouse to switch the crystal ball in the shooter cannon with the crystal ball color shown in the gem on the back of the shooter.</P>
<P>To quit the game or change your options, click the Menu button in the top right.</P>
<P><A name="HTP/Objective"><B>Objective</B></A></P>
<P>The object of Zuma is to eliminate all the crystal balls rolling onscreen before they reach the Hole of Realm. <b class="caution">When a crystal ball reaches the Hole of Realm, you will lose one of your lives. When all your lives are gone... Game Over!</b></P>
<P>How do you eliminate crystal balls? Easy! When there is a group of 3 or more crystal balls of the same color touching, they explode! Practice your aim to make sets quickly and efficiently!</P>
<P><A name="HTP/ZumaMeter"><B>Progress Bar</B></A></P>
<P>On the top bar you will see a small golden bar that fills as you destroy crystal balls. When you completely fill this meter, the progress bar will becomes rainbow bar and all the crystal balls will roll backwards for a moment. No new crystal balls will enter the screen after this, so you just have to clean up the remaining crystal balls to finish the level.</P>
<P><A name="HTP/PowerupBalls"><B>Powerup Balls</B></A></P>
<P>You will be aided in your task by Powerup Balls that appear occasionally. These will turn back into normal crystal balls after a while if you don't use them, so learn to recognize the different types! All Powerup Balls can be triggered  by detonating them as part of a set.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><B><img src="images/baSlowBlue.gif" width="16" height="16">Snail Trigger:</B> All the crystal balls will slow down.</LI>
	<LI><B><img src="images/baBombBlue.gif" width="16" height="16">Nova Bomb:</B> This will cause a huge blast, destroying all crystal balls in its radius.</LI>
	<LI><B><img src="images/baBackwardsBlue.gif" width="16" height="16">Reverse:</B> This will cause all the crystal balls to move backwards for a moment.</LI>
	<LI><B><img src="images/baAccuracyBlue.gif" width="16" height="16">Accelerate:</B> This will give your shooter an aiming beam and increased firing speed, making it much easier to get the crystal balls where you want them to go.</LI>
</UL>
<P><A name="HTP/Coins"><B>Rainbow Coins</B></A></P>
<P>From time to time you will see a Rainbow coin appear. Shoot these with a crystal ball to score big bonus points! If you can hit more than 1 coin on a single level, you'll get even more!</P>
<P><A name="HTP/Combos"><B>Combos</B></A></P>
<P>You can make tons of extra points by scoring combos. A combo occurs when you cause two or more explosions by firing a single crystal ball. That is, one explosion causes the crystal balls on either side to slide together and detonate, perhaps chain-reacting into a third explosion, and so on. These take some time and care to set up, but they're worth it!</P>
<P><A name="HTP/Chains"><B>Chains</B></A></P>
<P>You can get a chain bonus by completing 5 or more sets in a row. That is, each crystal ball you fire must cause a detonation. If you can cause 6 or more in a row, you'll score big points!</P>
<P><A name="HTP/Gaps"><B>Gaps</B></A></P>
<P>If you can fire a crystal ball through a gap in the crystal balls so that it goes through and creates a set on the other side, you'll receive a gap bonus! If you can do it through two gaps, you'll get the rare double gap bonus!  On some levels, a triple gap was very rare, but a triple gap bonus might even be possible!</P>
<P><A name="HTP/AceTime"><B>Ace Time</B></A></P>
<P>If you can finish a level really quickly, you may qualify for an Ace Time bonus! On the level up screen you'll see your time and the Ace Time. You'll get bonus points for every second by which you beat Ace Time.  Press the 't' key to see how much time remains to get the Ace Time bonus.</P>

<P class=header>
<A name="AM"><B>Adventure</B> <A href="#top">[back to top]</A></A>
</P>

<P>Adventure mode is ideal for players new to Zuma, also in the mod. You must battle through multiple portals/500 levels to find the secrets of Anime!</P>
<P>Each portal is divided into three stages, and each stage is divided into several levels. When you complete an entire stage, your progress in the game is saved. Next time you play, you can skip ahead to the next stage you were working on. You can still go back and play earlier stages if you like, by clicking on the respective gateways in the Adventure screen.</P>
<P>When you start a level for the first time, it will be unlocked to play in Gauntlet mode later.</P>
<P>This mod have 500 levels.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><B>Stage 1 ~ 3:</B> 40 Levels in each stages(Anime 1 ~ Anime 120) within 3 colors ball(But sometimes 4 colors, just bug...?).</LI>
	<LI><B>Stage 4 ~ 6:</B> 40 Levels in each stages(Anime 121 ~ Anime 240), added green ball.</LI>
	<LI><B>Stage 7 ~ 9:</B> 40 Levels in each stages(Anime 241 ~ Anime 360), added purple ball.</LI>
	<LI><B>Stage 10 ~ 12:</B> 40 Levels in each stages(Anime 361 ~ Anime 480), added white ball.</LI>
	<LI><B>Stage 13(Final):</B> 20 Levels(Anime 481 ~ Anime 500), added 7th ball.</LI>
    </UL>
<P>You'll get a surprise when you complete each portal. Can you discover the final stage?</P>

<P class=header>
<A name="GM"><B>Gauntlet Mode</B> <A href="#top">[back to top]</A></A>
</P>

<P>Gauntlet mode is for more experienced Zuma players. You must unlock levels in Adventure mode in order to play them in Gauntlet mode. Now your challenge is to work your way up the ranks from Casual to Insane, earning a Rainbow Gem for each portal.</P>
<P><A name="GM/Ran"><B>Random</B></A></P>
<P>When you have the Random map selected, you will progress through a series of levels chosen randomly from maps you have unlocked. Difficulty will increase with each new map. The Random mode can be accessed by cycling thru all the maps with the two arrow buttons.</P>
<P><A name="GM/Spe"><B>Specific</B></A></P>
<P>Use the Back and Next buttons at the bottom of the screen to select a specific portal to play. You must have unlocked the level from within Adventure mode to be able to play it. You will then play an endless game on that single map. This is also good for practicing. The longer you survive, the higher your rank will rise, until you earn a Rainbow Gem for the map.</P>
<P><A name="GM/Pra"><B>Practice</B></A></P>
<P>If you enable Practice mode, you will play the selected level over and over, just as in Adventure mode. This way, you can try to improve your performance on specific levels.</P>
<P><A name="GM/Sur"><B>Survival</B></A></P>
<P>In Survival mode, you will have a non-stop stream of balls rolling onscreen, faster and faster, until you ultimately perish. How far can you make it before being overwhelmed?</P>

<P class=header>
<A name="SC"><B>Scoring</B> <A href="#top">[back to top]</A></A>
</P>

<P>You get an extra life every 50,000 points.</P>
<P>Exploded crystal balls are scored at 10 points each.</P>
<P>A combo is initiated when multiple explosions are triggered with one shot. The first explosion is scored normally. The second gives a bonus of 100 points, the third 200, the fourth 300, etc. </P>
<P>A chain is created when at least five subsequent shots generate five subsequent explosions. At the 5th explosion a bonus of 100 points is awarded. The bonus for every subsequent explosion is calculated by taking the previous bonus and adding 10 points. So the bonus for the fifth explosion would be 100, the 6th would be 110, the 7th would be 120, and so on. </P>
<P>If a gap is created along the curve, a ball can be fired through the gap to cause an explosion on the other side. The bonus ranges from 10 to 500 points. A large gap is worth 10 points, while something closer to the size of the ball is worth 500 (or 250 in Survival mode). If multiple gaps are cleared in a single shot, the best of the bonuses is multiplied by the number of gaps to figure the scoring bonus. </P>
<P>Another way to score points is by shooting rainbow coins that appear in certain areas along the curve. If a rainbow coin is shot, a bonus of 1/6th the level's target score (rounded down to the nearest hundred) is gained. In Adventure or Practice mode, the lowest possible coin value is 500 points regardless of the target score. In Survival mode, the lowest possible value is 200 points. The target score is equal to the number of points needed to fill the Progress Bar.</P>
<P>Two additional bonuses are scored at the end of each level. A bonus is given based on the distance from the last destroyed ball to the entrance of the Hole of Realm. An award of 100 points per 60 pixels is given.</P> 
<P>A second bonus is awarded for speed. The player's time to clear the level is pitted against a unique and static Ace Time. If the time is equal to or lower than the Ace Time, an award of 100 points is awarded. If the Ace Time is beaten (not tied) the difference, measured as a percentage between the two times, is multiplied by 25,000 and awarded in addition to the initial 100 points. If the time was not beaten, no bonus is awarded.</P>
